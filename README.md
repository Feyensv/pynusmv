# PyNuSMV
PyNuSMV is a Python binding for NuSMV. It is intended to provide a Python
interface to NuSMV, allowing to use NuSMV as a library.

More details about this tool are provided in the PyNuSMV documentation
(see the DOCUMENTATION section below).

## Preliminary warning
PyNuSMV does NOT work with Python 2 !

## Installation
Give some instructions for the installation. Should revolve around a plain
````
pip3 install pynusmv
````

## Build
Building PyNuSMV requires you to have a few standard tools available on your
computer. Typically the build process should work nice and smooth on all platform
although only OSX was really tested.

### Dependencies
The first thing the build process performs in before even stating to try building
PyNuSMV is to check the availability of the following system requirements.
Unfortunately, no guarantee regarding the exhaustivity of this list can be given
although we have strong confidence that it is sufficient.

  * An ANSI C compiler (gcc will do, as will several versions of cc)
  * A C++ compiler (g++ advised)
  * GNU Flex version 2.5 or greater
  * GNU Bison version 1.22 or greater
  * GNU make utility version 3.74 or greater
  * GNU tar, gzip and unzip (to unpack the sources of the dependencies)
  * GNU patch (to fix some files in the original project distributions)
  * GNU ar and ranlib to create static libraries
  * GNU ln command
  * SWIG version 2.0.6 or higher -- http://www.swig.org/
  * Python3 (version 3.2 or higher) -- http://python.org/
  * Setuptools 2.1 or higher -- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools
  * pyparsing version 2.0.2 or higher -- http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/

In addition to these, you will need to have `libexpat` installed on your system
(SWIG on OSX also requires `pcre` but this might not be mandatory on all
platforms moreover, you can simply your swig installed with `brew install swig`
and that should be enough).

### Build process
To build and install your distribution of pynusmv from the sources, you should
proceed with the following command:
`python3 setup.py install`

This will start by unpacking, patching and building the following dependencies:
  * MiniSat
  * CUDD
  * NuSMV

Once that is done, the actual core of setup.py will be executed. This involves
building the dynamic libraries for the lower interface and package the python
modules that build above that lower interface. As usual, depending on the command
you pass to setuptools, the output will be produced under `build` or `dist`.

### Verifying your build
To check if the compilation was successfull, you can run the unit tests:
`python3 -m unittest`

## DOCUMENTATION
The full API of (the upper interface of) PyNuSMV can be generated thanks
to Sphinx (http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) by running: `make html`
in the doc/ directory. The documentation is then available in the
doc/html/index.html page. Other userful information like a presentation
of the tool and a short tutorial are also given.

The same documentation is also available on http://pynusmv.readthedocs.org/.

### FIXME: Chances are high that the documentation be broken

## Content
This package contains:
  - this README.md file;
  - TOOLS.md : notes about the tools provided with PyNuSMV;
  - dependencies/ : a directory containing the dependencies project necessary to pynusmv
  - pynusmv : the package containig the whole upper interface of pynusmv
  - pynusmv_lower_interface : the package containing the wole lower interface of pynusmv
  - setup.py : PyNuSMV compilation file;

### FIXME: Add the tests again

Note that pre-compiled versions have less content because only the minimal
required files (i.e. PyNuSMV files and nusmv shared library) are included.
